# QLog

QLog is an Amateur Radio logging application for Linux, Windows and Mac OS. It
is based on the Qt 5 framework und uses SQLite as database backend.

QLogs aims to be as simple as possible, but to provide everything the operator expects from the log. This log is not currently focused on contests.
